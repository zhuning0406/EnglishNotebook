## 正文

I’ve just made myself a cup of tea and I should do some housework soon, but, it got me thinking about two words that many students find very difficult to use.

此句中的 get 是不完全及物动词，译为“让···、叫···”，句式是 get sb to do sth，有类似用法的有 have、make、let，句子中的用法是 get sb doing 不知道是不是惯常用法。

Today , I want to talk to you about ‘make' and ‘do'.

So why are these words so difficult to use.

The answer is that both words have very similar meanings, and, in many languages they use one word, like ‘hacker’ in Spanish .

So what is the main difference?

Well with ‘make’ you are creating something that did’t exist before, whilst with ‘do’ you’re completing a task that already exists.

Now please remember as with all English concepts there are always exceptions and I will talk about those after I’ve explained the most important parts.

as with 译为“如同；和···一样；就···而言”

So things that we can create from scratch: 

A coffee or tea: shall I make you one?

An offer: I’d like to make you an offer.

Can I make a suggestion?

Alright, but only if you make me a promise.

only if:只有当：I'll tell you, but only if you don't tell anyone else.

***\*only if从句在句首，主句用倒装句结构：\****Only if one believes in something can one act purposefully.

if only:要是…多好：If only I had known you then.

Also: I think I’ve made a mistake.

I’d like to make a complaint!

Who’s making that noise/sound?

I’ve make a really important discovery.

Most things to do with business go with make. 

go with 和···一起；伴随

for example: profit and lose

Last month I made a loss but this month I want to make a profit.

You can also make an investment into somebody else’s business.

译为：对某人的生意进行投资

And also, if things go really well for you and you earn a lot of money you will have made a fortune.

made a fortune 大发横财

Now let’s talk about ‘do’.

I’ve already told you that ‘do’ is when you complete a task that already exists.

For example: every night I do my homework.

Next week I have to do a test.

In science we did experiments.

I hope I don’t have to do any interviews soon!

Housework chores are tasks, and that’s an important one to remember.

I hate doing the shopping.

I don’t mind doing the dishes.

But I loathe ,and that means really hate, doing the ironing.

You can also do well or badly at something.

I did badly in an exam last summer, so now I have to do it again.

You can do bad or good. Doing good is doing something positive.

If you eat healthily, you do yourself good.

You also do your best, or do your worst.

I’ve got my red pen out!

It’s exception time and unfortunately there are many exceptions to do with ‘make’ and ‘do’.

I told you that most things to do with money and business go with make.

However, have you ever heard the phrase ‘Pleasure doing business with you?’.

Business, just the word, goes with do.

We do business with someone.

I also said that housework and chores go with do. 

But when I get up in the morning I should make my bed.

I also said that make was to do with creation.

So we create art, right? Wrong, we do a drawing.

And finally, girls, hair and make-up.

I do my hair, and also do my make-up.

Sorry, just doing my lipstick.

That's it for ‘make’ and ‘do’.
