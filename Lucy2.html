<h2 id="&#x6B63;&#x6587;">&#x6B63;&#x6587;</h2>
<p>Hang on!</p>
<p>OK! Let&apos;s talk about phrasal verbs.</p>
<p>Hello and welcome to my introduction to phrasal verbs.</p>
<p>So you&apos;ve got verb and proposition that you recognize but together they mean something different.</p>
<p>I&apos;m going to explain how phrasal verbs are formed, the different types of phrasal verbs and how they are used and then I&apos;ll give you explanation of ten of the most common ones.</p>
<p>So, how do we form a phrasal verb?</p>
<p>Well, as I said before, we add a proposition to a verb.</p>
<p>For example , </p>
<p>&quot;look&quot;, which is out verb and then a proposition could be &apos;out&apos;. I look out of the window.</p>
<p>However , If I were to say &apos;look out, there`s a car.&apos;</p>
<p>The meaning is changed, because we&apos;ve changed the situation and the context.</p>
<p>So in this case it would mean &apos;be careful, there&apos;s a car!&apos;</p>
<p>So I&apos;m going to guide you through four important hints that will help you use phrasal verbs more efficiently and more effectively.</p>
<p>It could also help your reading and listening skills.</p>
<p>The first hint is that you can&apos;t always understand phrasal verbs by looking at the individual words.</p>
<p>A good example of this is &apos;turn out&apos;. &apos;Turn&apos;, on it&apos;s own, means to rotate but together with &apos;on&apos; it means to active function.</p>
<p>I turn on the television. Something completely different.</p>
<p>That&apos;s why in your reading and listening exams you mustn&apos;t listen word by word. You have to try and understand the phrase as a whole.</p>
<p>So now on to hint two. </p>
<p>One phrasal verb can have multiple meanings.</p>
<p>We&apos;ve got the same phrasal verb, &apos;take off&apos; here in two different situations. </p>
<p>&apos;Take off your jacket&apos; means &apos;remove your jacket&apos;.</p>
<p>&apos;The plane takes off soon.&apos; means &apos;the plane leaves soon&apos;.</p>
<p>So, how can you know which of the meanings are being intended?</p>
<p>Well, the main way to do this is to look at the context and the situation around the phrasal verbs.</p>
<p>So, here we got a jacket, well I know jacket is clothing, so it&apos;s probable it&apos;s going to mean remove.</p>
<p>I can see plane here, it&apos;s probable going to be ahout something going into the air.</p>
<p>So now for hint number three.</p>
<p>Some phrasal verbs are separable. With the phrasal verb &quot;to put on&quot; which means to start wearing something. We can use it in two ways.</p>
<p>I can say &apos;I put on my dress.&apos; and I can alse say &apos;I put my dress on.&apos;</p>
<p>This object here can go between the verb and the preposition. The meaning doesn&apos;t change.</p>
<p>You must learn which phrasal verbs are separable and which aren&apos;t.</p>
<p>The example before with &apos;take off&apos; this cannot be separated.</p>
<p>And finally, number four. </p>
<p>Sometimes you can make a normal verb sound more conversational or even childish if you add a preposition.</p>
<p>For example: &apos;eat your dinner.&apos; &apos;eat up your dinner.&apos;</p>
<p>I would be more inclined to say &apos;eat up your dinner.&apos; to a child.</p>
<p>The same goes for &apos;sit at the table&apos; and &apos;sit down at the table.&apos;</p>
<p>The meaning doesn&apos;t change, it&apos;s just more conversational or childish.</p>
<p>Ok , now we&apos;ve explained how they&apos;re used. I&apos;m going to give you ten really common and useful phrasal verbs starting with &apos;to break up&apos;.</p>
<p>We have two meanings here </p>
<p>Tom and joe have broken up. This means that they have stopped their relationship.</p>
<p>And then we also have &apos;school breaks up next week&apos;. This means that school finishes for the holidays.</p>
<p>Next we have &apos;carry on&apos;. If you want to speak better English, you should carry on watching. Carry on means to continue.</p>
<p>Then we have &apos;come on&apos;. Come on! If you don&apos;t hurry we&apos;ll miss the train. In this case, come on means hurry.</p>
<p>The next one is &apos;find out&apos;. I need to find out when the train leaves. I need to discover or become aware of when the train leaves.</p>
<p>Then we have &apos;get on&apos; or &apos;get along&apos;. These mean the same. I get on very well with my flatmates. I have a good relationship with my flatmates. </p>
<p>If I change well to badly, it means the opposite.</p>
<p>Next we have &apos;grow up&apos;. I grew up in a village near to London. This means that I spent my childhood or became an adult in a village near London.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re behaving immaturely, someone might say &apos;grow up&apos;. This could mean you need to behave like an adult.</p>
<p>Next we have &apos;look after&apos;. Can you look after my dog this week? Can you care for my dog this week?</p>
<p>So, the next one is &apos;pick up&apos;. Your phone is ringing, pick it up! This means to answer it.</p>
<p>The next one, can you pick me up for work? Can you collect me for work?</p>
<p>Then we have &apos;to run out&apos;. Oh, no! All my phone battery has run out. It has became empty or finished.</p>
<p>And the final one, &apos;throw away&apos;. This milk is too old, I need to throw it away. I need to put it in the bin.</p>
<p>That was just an introduction so there is a lot of more to learn and many more phrasal verbs!</p>
<p>But I hope to do further explanations and other videos on phrasal verbs very very soon.</p>
